### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a Software Engineer by Profession. I enjoy working with data and visualizations. I've got a passion for all things data, from statistics to visualizations and everything in between. Some might even call me a data whisperer, able to coax insights from even the most unruly datasets. When I'm not slinging code, you can usually find me exploring the great outdoors or searching for the perfect cup of coffee. In fact, I firmly believe that a well-brewed cup of coffee is essential to any successful data analysis session.

I've got a keen eye for detail and a dedication to producing high-quality work. Whether I'm wrangling data or building out a dashboard, I'm always striving to deliver top-notch results. So if you're looking for a data rockstar who isn't afraid to bring a little personality to the table, look no further. Let's grab a cup of coffee (or three) and chat about how I can help you turn your data dreams into a reality.
